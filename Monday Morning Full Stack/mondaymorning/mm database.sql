Following on these lines, the Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering of NIT Rourkela has recently collaborated with the Institute of Technology of Metals of National Academy of Science, Belarus. This is the first ever Indian collaboration with the academia of Belarus and is entitled as the “India-Belarus Inter-governmental Science and Technology Cooperation Programme.”\r\n\r\nThe project articulates two different countries’ scientific research community i.e.  Institute of Technology of Metals, Belarus and NIT, Rourkela. While the Indian counterparts administer the Modelling and Simulation part of the work, the Belarusian counterparts cater to the experimental as well as the industrial needs of the job. The institute in Belarus has a great Process metallurgy lab and possess a good facility of the continuous casting process for various kinds of metal. Working together has brought about an exchange of knowledge, technological understanding and implementation of novel modelling tools for the development of continuous casting process. The project investigators include Dr Snehanshu Pal and Dr Anindya Basu from NIT Rourkela as well as Dr Yury A. Lebedinsky and Yauheny Marukovich from Institute of Technology of Metals, Belarus.\r\n\r\nThe project is entitled as the “Investigation of solidification process and prediction of microstructure during secondary cooling in continuous casting of plain carbon steel to estimate the porosity fraction and carbon segregated by multiscale simulation.” The objective of the project is to develop a microstructure model of Continuous casting process so that one can understand the concept of Segregation as well as the columnar and equiaxed grain distribution over the domain of continuously casted steel through Cellular Automata and Phase field modelling techniques. Modelling the heat transfer and segregation model for different cooling conditions as well as process parameters is the key goal of the entire collaborative effort. The commencement was done in September 2016 and until now, the macrostructural development has been done.', 'Read on to know more about the first Indian collaboration with Belarus by the Metallurgy and Materials engineering department of NIT Rourkela.', 'test1.jpg', 0, 23, '2018-06-28 12:37:15'),

Team Monday Morning caught up with Medha Rath, who was more than happy to share her journey leading up to her acceptance in UMD. Here’s what she had to say  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMonday Morning: How did Integrated MSc Chemistry in NIT Rourkela happen to you?\r\n\r\nMedha Rath: From the beginning, I was inclined to study science instead of Engineering. I had enrolled myself in DU for Maths, it was then that my JEE results came out. So, after accessing my options, I made a decision to pursue Chemistry here, I was anyways interested in Chemistry from long back.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMM: When did you make your mind up to do a PhD?  \r\n\r\nMR: It was always in the plan. In my first year, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do, but later on, as I started doing internships and as I kept studying up about a subject, I realised that the next thing that I want to do is a PhD. I never wanted to do a job right after graduation. My interest in research was increased due to the internships that I had done. So, I think by my second year, I had made up my mind for a PhD.\r\n\r\nMM: Tell us about the Internships that you have done.\r\n\r\nMR: In my second year I had interned in CSIR, Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology (IMMT), Bhubaneswar. During that, I worked under a professor on Environment and Sustainability. Looking back, this one internship didn’t really help me much. I then did a very short research internship under one of the Professors here, Prof. Supratim Giri. After working for 2 months, I decided not to continue any further, primarily because I was not able to manage it along with my classes. Under him, I didn’t get to do much work, but I got to read up a lot about many things, this developed my interest in Material Sciences and its application in Bio-Medicines.\r\n\r\nNext, I did an internship in IIT Bombay, under Ajit Kulkarni. He was the chairman of Metallurgy and Material Science Department there. I worked in the Centre for Research in Nano Science and Technology. My work was basically drug delivery systems in cancer cells. In my fourth year, I did an internship in IISc Bangalore under Prof. Sangram Samal, having received an Indian Academic Science (IAS) fellowship, my research there was more or less on the same thing as last time.', 'Read on to learn about Medha\'s stellar achievements, the girl who is soon flying away to live her US dreams with a coveted PhD admit in the prestigious University of ', 'test2.jpg', 0, 14, '2018-06-28 12:37:44'),

Scheduled to begin at 9, the event was delayed by half an hour and commenced with the unveiling of the plaque and the cutting of the ceremonial ribbon by our honoured Director, Prof. Animesh Biswas.\r\n\r\nOver the past year, we have witnessed the instalment of CCTV cameras at various locations on the campus premises. In the first phase 31 cameras were installed, and this number was then increased to 41. The areas being covered include the LA lawns, the library entrances, the BBA foyer, Institute gates and almost all the hostel entrances. This has led to satisfy two objectives. One, the security is much tighter. And two, depending upon both technology and manpower has proven to be more effective. Quoting Dr. Pankaj Kumar Sa, CSE department,\r\n\r\nThe genesis of this project goes to a much deeper level than just increase in security. It also addresses the expenditure incurred. Ours is an educational institute and we must spend more on educational quests than on security. But at the same time, security is something that we cannot overlook. We aimed to figure out a technological solution to tackle this issue. So we went for a capital expenditure, a one-time expenditure, on something like this, to cover the vital and strategic points, thus ensuring the effectual reduction in manpower expenditure.\r\nThe Surveillance Control Room has been established to attentively monitor the feeds of these cameras. With the storage capacity of 32 TB in rate configuration amounting to an effective storage of 15 TB, video feeds for an entire month can be stored and accessed. Presently, 28 out of the 41 cameras are functional. At the initial stage, the vital installments and the gates at the periphery were being covered, but all these locations did not have the proper network infrastructure. The network laid down is that of wired communication with optical fiber and all the installations are IP based.  There were other mechanisms which were not preferred, as it would be too redundant and the management would be difficult over such a huge area. The foundation for the surveillance system has been satisfactorily laid down, and up to 256 cameras can be catered to in this system.\r\n\r\nSome of the important areas in the campus, however, owing to the lack of the required network infrastructure, are still not under the surveillance system. The area extending from the Ceramic Engineering department to the swimming pool, to the C. V. Raman hostel, is yet to be covered. The process to develop both the network and surveillance infrastructure is ongoing, with plans to increase the number of cameras around the campus in near future. The work is still in progress and time is required for the surveillance infrastructure is to be made more robust.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Security Officer, Suman Dutta, states,', 'The launch of the Surveillance Control Room for overseeing all surveillance activity in the campus would be a major boost to security, authorities say.

Apart from the public impression that makes the highest contribution to an institution’s reputation, there are several Survey and accreditations carried out by various organizations which publish comparative reports on an institute’s performance. Since educational surveys abound in plenty and employ means of testing that vary widely, there have been several questions and debates over the nitty-gritty of these surveys. In this article, we seek to answer many of those questions, as well as analyze how NITR have been faring in this year’s rankings, prominently the prestigious NIRF that was published on the 3rd of April this year.\r\n\r\nThe National Institutional Rankings Framework (NIRF) is one of the most highly-esteemed and universally acknowledged surveys conducted and approved by the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD). NITR has been participating and consistently competing for a ‘top-10’ position in this survey since it was launched in 2016.\r\n\r\nSurveys and accreditations are done on the basis of various parameters that assess an institute’s performance in that field over a period. These include markers like research, infrastructure, faculty strength, placements, connectivity and more. Most surveys are conducted on an annual basis and institutes are numerically marked on the above points, following which a rank is given. Apart from MHRD, other organizations like Times Higher Education and QS University rankings also conduct these surveys.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to assess and rank an institute. While surveying, institutes may be categorized into Technical, Medical or Law, Management, or Architectural education institutes, as well as on a hierarchical basis like Govt. sponsored or autonomous, university or college or an IIT/NIT. For evaluating, some survey officials may visit the campus in person, or solicit postal or online submission of data, or even conduct polls/surveys among the students and teachers. With a significant amount of raw data assessed, and parameters varying from one survey to another, the rankings of institutes may largely differ too and have been a subject of extensive debates for some time. Nevertheless, specific surveys are well accepted by a large fraction of the scholarly community and referred by several recruiters and patrons while approaching an institute. The NIRF (https://www.nirfindia.org/About) is one such significant framework of institutional surveys.', 'Read on to learn more about our analysis of the Annual NIRF rankings for NIT-Rourkela, which put us at a staggeringly remarkable position of 15th in its third year of assessment\r\n\r\n', 'test5.jpg', 0, 1, '2018-06-28 12:39:02'),

Becoming an engineer is no less demanding than becoming a superhero. We, Team Monday Morning, with our decade-long acquaintance with the protocols here, assure you that your college experience is going to be just as enriching as that of an Avenger at National Institute of Technology, Rourkela: the S.H.I.E.L.D of Engineering.\r\n\r\nNational Institute of Technology, Rourkela, popularly known as NITR, has battled all odds to hold the 2nd position among all NITs in India, ranked 15th by the NIRF in the engineering category, and 126th in the BRICS ranking. Truly a tremendous achievement to behold! Well, S.H.I.E.L.D was not built in a day, so let\'s look at what makes NITR the best place for engineering!\r\n\r\nA HOME IN THE HILL\r\nA picturesque city, hidden away among hills and dense tropical forests and mines which produces a precious metal. Sounds like Wakanda? Oh, wait! it’s called Rourkela. Exuberant green forests, a tropical climate, plentiful rainfall, dramatic temperatures ranges as high as 49°C and as low as 5°C? Rourkela is all this and much more! Situated in northern Odisha, Rourkela, which goes by the monikers of Ispat Nagar and Steel City, is the industrial capital of Odisha. Enwreathed by hills on three sides, Rourkela sits at the confluence of rivers Koel and Sankha which flow into the river Brahmani.\r\n\r\nClassified by the Government of India as a ‘Smart City’, Rourkela is a quaint cosmopolitan town; home to two gems of India: National Institutes of Technology, Rourkela[NITR] and the Rourkela Steel Plant[RSP]. Sector-2, Ambagan, Ispat Market and Udit Nagar serve as market destinations for all things small and big. The market areas, as well as the railway station, are connected by the 16-km Ring Road which runs around the city.\r\n\r\nREACHING ROURKELA\r\nThe Bifrost is the primary pathway for Asgardians to and from  Asgard. Well, In Rourkela we have not one Bifrost but two! The railways and roadways. A third Bifrost in the form of an airport is underway and is expected to start functioning by the end of the year.\r\n\r\nThe closest airports are in Ranchi, Raipur, Bhubaneswar, and Kolkata (in order of increasing distance from Rourkela). All of these places are extremely well connected. The name of the railway station is Rourkela Junction (ROU). It is situated 6 km away from campus in the heart of the city. The fare is fixed at INR 120 for the auto rickshaws from the station. In addition to this, there are alternatives such as Ola Cabs and car rental services at your disposal so that you’re never inconvenienced. The nearest bus stop is at Sector 2 which is about a kilometre away from campus: Intercity and Interstate buses are available here. There is also a local city bus available from the railway station to sector 2 for convenient commutes.\r\n\r\nTEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION\r\nBefore you are allotted a Hostel, you might find boarding and lodging facilities handy. There are many hotels as well as lodges and inns, spread over Rourkela for you to comfortably stay after tiring journeys and long commutes. The popular luxury ones are MN International, Hotel Kanishk, The Central Park, Mayfair Rourkela, Hotel Tridev, Radhika Regency and Hotel Brindaban and Shyam. Click on the link below to get more info.\r\nhttp://www.nitrkl.ac.in/IndustryAlumni/11Travel/Hotels.aspx\r\n\r\nThere is also an on-campus guest house which requires prior booking but has the advantage of making your commutes brief and accessible. For more info click on the link below.\r\nGuest House\r\n\r\nNECESSARY SUPPLIES\r\nOwing to the essential need of everyday supplies and commodities of the residents, NITR has an on-campus variety store ‘Rangoli’, located in the midst of  Scholar’s Avenue in front of the GDB Hall of Residence. In addition to that, an uprising market complex comprising of grocery, stationery and variety stores called ‘Needs’, is situated in the vicinity of KMS Hall of Residence, adjacent to the main entrance of the campus. The shops are well stocked and offer a wide range of products. Within the academic area, J.D. enterprises and Student Bookstore have an exclusive stationery store and a book depot to cater to the requirements of university supplies.\r\n\r\nListing the popular shopping areas in a decreasing order of proximity from the campus:\r\nSector 2 Marketplace (1.8 km); VIP Market (5.4 km) housing some top-notch showrooms; Ispat Market: the oldest everyday market popularly known as Ambagan (5.5 km) - famous for fresh fruits and vegetables along with daily commodities at a minimal rate; and the Kachery Road Market (7.5 km) which has many supermarkets, a Big Bazaar and high profile stores of apparels, jewelry, textiles and handicrafts.\r\n\r\nA RECCE THROUGH THE NITR ALLEYS\r\nThe NIT Rourkela campus, covering a huge 1200 acres, provides one of the best opportunities regarding infrastructure and other necessary facilities to groom a trainee into an able Avenger on the similar lines of the S.H.I.E.L.D. The campus is beautifully adorned with the mesmerising gifts of nature and man-made marvels in perfect symphony. The lush greenery and well-planned infrastructure is a sight to behold but hard to explore on foot. Cycles serve as the perfect companions for any NITian and will be available for purchase when the retailers camp near the Bhubaneswar Behera Auditorium premises.\r\n\r\n‘Healthy food is the prime necessity for a healthy body and mind’. The mess aptly provides generous amounts of healthy meals to all the hostellers, but monotonicity makes an aspiring Avenger’s life dull. To satiate the taste buds of the ‘self-proclaimed foodies’, there are numerous food joints in the campus, be it the Jo’z Kitchen and the Hexagon in the Scholars’ Avenue or the Mokshaa and the Dosa Plaza in the Technology Avenue or the Rengcol and the Srinivasa Lunch Room (SLR) in the Academic Area. With the advent of technology, these food joints have started accepting card payments and other cashless pathways along with a student-friendly timetable which has made the Avengers’ lives easier. The Nescafe, Amul Parlour and the Departmental stores near the Campus Gate serve as the perfect hangout place for the Avengers. They satisfy their ‘sweet-tooth’ and refresh the tired minds after long hours of study and toil.\r\n\r\n‘An Avenger must be an All-Rounder’. There are two stadiums, the Dilip Tirkey Stadium (DTS) and the Sachin Tendulkar Sports Complex (STSC) for the boarders to play their favourite sports for recreation or to hone their athletic skills. Extra-academic courses like NSS, NCC and Physical Education (PE) along with regular jogging too are held on allotted two days in a week for the all-round development of the Avenger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBanking facilities are available in the SBI Bank in the campus premises along with four ATMs which help the Avenger monetarily to fulfill his/her needs. The two SBI ATMs are conveniently placed near the first-year boys’ hostels while another SBI ATM and an Axis Bank ATM are in the Residential Area and the Academic Area respectively. Besides, there are three temples in the campus itself for the religious folks.', 'Welcome to NITR, where amateurs grow up as tomorrow\'s technocrats through an adventurous journey that is as sweet as Hulk’s lullaby, yet no less challenging than Captain America’s training.

The grand event started in 1930 and has been held every 4 years ever since, barring the 1942 and ’46 editions due to the second World War.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the World Cup is that while 32 countries get to cheer for their respective teams, the event also affirms a global pluralism- it is as much of a festival of cultural multiplicity as it is a competition featuring some of the best athletes in the world and has an aim of bringing the people of world together -Clint Smith\r\n \r\n\r\nThe FIFA World Cup brings together the best 32 teams on the planet after three years of qualifier rounds, who fight it out for the illustrious trophy. For many, football is not just a sport, there’s emotion involved, there’s passion. With people all around the world fixated on this event, it almost always turns out to be a fascinating affair. Now in its 21st edition, with superstar names like Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar, Pogba, Hazard, all involved for their countries, Russia is your place to be, this summer. The FIFA World Cup 2018 is taking place in 12 stadia across 11 cities throughout the great country (and two continents!) from 14 June to 15 July 2018. With a cumulative audience of more than 26 billion people watching the last World Cup, and almost a ninth of the entire global population (715.1 million) being spectators for the finals alone, the World Cup by far exceeds the popularity of other prestigious events including the Olympics.\r\n\r\nThe official song for FIFA World Cup, Russia is “Live it up” by Nicky Jam, featuring Will Smith and Era Istrefi, promising to fill the stadiums around Russia with a lively atmosphere to bring fans together. Adidas Telstar 18 is the official match ball of this World Cup.\r\n\r\nThis World Cup will miss the presence of stars like Arjen Robben, Robin Van Persie, Gianluigi Buffon, Alexis Sanchez, Arturo Vidal as Netherlands, Italy and Chile were the ‘big’ teams not able to qualify for the World Cup. The tournament is still believed to be a super-hit affair because of the involvement of many other superstar names. It might also turn out to be the World Cup for many stalwarts of the game like Leo Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Andres Iniesta, Sergio Ramos, Manuel Neuer and Luis Suarez.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis World Cup is into its third week now; the early signs indicate that we are in for a marvellous summer. The world cup has already seen some shocking results, some absolutely awe-inspiring performances and some edge-of-the-seat thrillers. This edition also marks the debut of Video Assistant Referees (VAR) in a World Cup. In the early stages, VAR has already been impactful in reducing the number of human-errors in the game, thereby making the beautiful game all the fairer. While the formidable Argentines have seen major upsets by Iceland and Croatia, the defending champions found themselves in a fighting ground for survival too, with a morale-shattering loss against Mexico and a narrow escape from Sweden. At least 3 teams have already been knocked out, and the battle for the Qualifying rounds have only grown ever more intense. While some teams like Russia, England, Belgium and France have been cruising through the group stages rather gracefully, others like Brazil, Germany and Switzerland have been providing some nail-biting finishers of late—all the more to their fans’ delight.\r\n\r\nHowever, the beautiful game has also seen some of the most memorable episodes ever. From Diego Maradona’s Hand of God to Dennis Bergkamp’s wonder goal, from Clive Thomas brilliant save against Zico of Brazil to the Miracle of Bern, the tournament has always been abounding with controversies and stunners. Meanwhile, the current generation would not forget easily Germany’s 7-1 bulldozing of a distraught Brazilian team in the 2014 semi-finals; or Zidane’s head-butt on Marco Materazzi that led to a straight red card in the 2006 finals, or even the South Koreans snatching an upset victory over Italy in 2002 after a disallowed goal. Alongside these encounters, there have also been a plethora of instances where both fair-play and fouls have shocked the fans to their core. From Patrick Battiston losing his teeth in a notorious foul and Roy Keane walking out on Ireland to Mario Goetze coming up with a sensational goal in dying minutes in an ecstatic world cup victory for the Krauts, the list for discussions would be endless.\r\n\r\nThe cup of glory and emotions has always managed to surprise its audience. Most of all, it has managed to bring together people from all walks of life, irrespective of faith, colour or ethnicity, to celebrate the best entertainment on earth, 90 minutes at a time. While as an Indian, we still earnestly await the historic day of witnessing our own jersey colours in the international arena, we cannot help meanwhile but be smitten with our own favourite teams-- every time we spend sleepless nights cheering for them, painting our cheeks with their flags, holding passionate debates about our favourite players and of course breathing and cheering and crying every bit for them all through.

KK MAHAPATRA\r\nMM: Why hasn’t the pre-registration taken place yet? Will there be a direct online registration this time?\r\n\r\nKKM: Pre-registration happens during the previous semester itself so that the students can get mentally prepared and the persisting issues can be sorted out at the level of Faculty Advisor and HoD. But this year, it has been delayed due to change in the curriculum, about which the students will be intimated soon. The pre-registration and registration are expected to happen on 23rd July. Institute opening might be delayed by a day, but students are expected to be here by 23rd July.\r\n\r\nMM: What changes have been made in the academic curriculum of NITR?\r\n\r\nKKM: There have been some modifications made in the academic curriculum of freshmen as well as M.Tech. students. For a Dual Degree student, in the 7th semester, he/she has to take some number of M.Tech. courses. A minor degree can be given to students on completion of the 2nd semester, based on CGPA. Mathematics has been made a compulsory course for the B.Tech. students. A compulsory English course has been introduced for PhD students.\r\n\r\nMM: What is the procedure for branch change that is supposed to be introduced from the current session? Why hasn’t there been any official mail regarding this yet?\r\n\r\nKKM: The policy of branch change did not exist in NITR for about last 10 years. It has been re-introduced this year. The Senate has already given its consent, and the minutes are yet to be circulated. A student should have a minimum CGPA of 8.5 to apply for branch change. Also, only 5% of the existing students of a particular branch can be allowed to change their branch. But it all depends on the vacancies available. We cannot let the total strength of a particular branch exceed the maximum limit. In order to change his/her branch, a student needs to be exceptionally well at academics. Only the B.Tech. students are allowed for this, that is, Integrated M.Sc. and Dual Degree students are forbidden to apply for branch change. The portal for this will soon be made available and informed.\r\n\r\nMM: There was a mail circulated regarding the Minor Degree course. What is the procedure for applying for it?\r\n\r\nKKM: The current 3rd-semester students of all streams (B.Tech., Dual Degree and Integrated M.Sc.) can apply for it. Students, having a minimum CGPA of 7.5, can choose 6 subjects for Minor Degree course of any branch.\r\n\r\nThe difference between OE and Minor Degree course is that instead of rambling from branch to branch every semester, students can now select 6 subjects from the same branch.\r\nThis was done for the reason that many of the companies look for candidates having good knowledge in subjects other than the specified branch of a student. For instance, there is a company that requires candidates extremely well in Electronics, but at the same time, he/she should have enough knowledge of Mechanical Engineering. If a student, due to some valid reasons, cannot cope up with the courses, he/she can definitely opt out of it.\r\n\r\nMM: Will there be a supplementary test in Open Elective for the students who get an F grade? What is it about the Minor Degree courses that the 3rd-semester students are made available to?\r\n\r\nKKM: Yes, the students can appear for the supplementary test of such courses. Open Elective will no more exist in the new curriculum. From the third semester, eligible students can apply for Minor Degree courses. Its registration portal will be available soon in the website. But the previous academic curriculum (for the batch of 2016 and before) will continue as it is, that is, they will still be having Open Elective courses.\r\n\r\nMM: On what grounds will a student get 0 marks in Teacher’s Assessment (TA)?\r\n\r\nKKM: There are no fixed rules laid down for awarding TA marks. We have completely left it to the professors. Marks can be given basing on the assignments, class tests, attendance, tutorial and classroom performances etc. There cannot be a uniform way in which the professors can follow because nature of all the courses is not similar. But if stray cases arise, it is required to be brought to the notice of the administration. \r\n\r\nMM: Can the students be provided with solutions or answers to the previous year question papers uploaded in the NITRIS portal?\r\n\r\nKKM:  The professors are necessarily required to submit the question papers in the academic section before evaluation of answer papers. But we have not asked them to give the solutions. This is because the examinations are not MCQ based, they are subjective. If students have any kind of doubt, they can consult their friends and professors.\r\n\r\nMM: If a student has a shortage in attendance, will the grade be reduced from P to F?\r\n\r\nKKM: Yes, whatever the grade is, if a student has a shortage in attendance, he/she will get a grade less.\r\n\r\nMM: What is the faculty-student ratio at NITR?\r\n\r\nKKM: This ratio strangely varies among departments. As far as the entire institute is concerned, it is 1:16, but ideally, it should be 1:12. The PhD students are not considered because they are all together in a separate stream.\r\n\r\nMM: What is the number of PhD students enrolled in this institute?\r\n\r\nKKM: The number of PhD students enrolling in NITR has proliferated in previous years. Presently, there are around 850 such students.', 'With the new session just around the corner, Team MM went around seeking answers to a host of queries concerning the student community.

(26, 'They Exist', 'they-exist', 'Views', 'Citizen Journalist', 'Anonymous', 1, 'They Exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don’t speak for the all-knowing universe, life and transience. I speak for myself and only with regard to what my understanding can fathom. My words won’t reverberate or echo or make a giant noise. It will be dim, faint and maybe catch someone else’s (like me) attention. Even if it doesn’t I don’t mind it dying down along the way. It doesn’t matter. After all, I am not sure what do I know of it anyway.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the fact that my life existed and will not exist and the transitory-ness etc. etc. has little to do with it. It is not dark but hopeful. I love the people I have met in my life and the amazing life has many fun-filled events. We all have memories, memories are who we are, they define us, shape us every second whether consciously or unconsciously. Memories are amazing and one thing is for sure that they will exist harmoniously even after ages of unintentional musings. A mere 70-80 years isn’t an era but for a person, it is so much more. It is more than any single book can encompass. An autobiography can only do so much justice.\r\nBut every person’s life is beyond the pages. An autobiography or a biography is a mere highlight of the most significant memories. But the ones which couldn’t be recollected or found still exist. They exist in their most significant forms i.e as a part of us. A sombre, humble and quiet part of us.\r\nThere was an institute I went to. A lifetime of memories and I never thought I could do any justice to it by writing a piece on it. Every moment unique and every moment was forgotten because we were living it then. Little did we know that these simple events would shape us in a big, big way. We would scratch our heads may be on a simple rainy day we would romanticize our way into our catacombs of idle reveries. So impertinent time has been. We have lost it but it always leaps at the very chance of reclaiming it. Not everything can be known as a human would say, not everything can be remembered also. But the very fact that years later\r\nwhen we turn back to cherish the salvaged remains, show us that some of them were not just moments. They were a lifetime in itself. Some memories take us away from the strangeness to those familiarities which were a revelation in itself. Many of the ones I know have walked the same roads to the classes of our college. Some of us have loved and lost and some have loved and won. Friends,\r\nteachers and comrades were formed. Brotherhood forged with the most unlikely of persons and pledges of staying connected with each other. Everyone special and everyone in regard. Some of us believe that it was our destiny and some believe it was just meant to happen but for most, it just happened, no prefix or suffix. It just happened. We attached ourselves to the people unknowingly\r\nthrough an undefinable language and loved the way life happened for us despite some unwanted tragedies and happenings. But I for one believe, we also have attached to those unspeakable objects that we loved secretly. For some, it might be a room, for some a tree, a road, a deserted alley, a restricted gateway, a simple crowd, a staircase and maybe, maybe even a Professor! I can’t keep count of all those for everyone else. There were many such undescribed objects, feelings, emotions, desires, events and ideas that remained and will remain despite being forgotten over time. They will exist and someday out of nowhere and for no reason at all they will crop up. Crop up in a weird manner that might make you feel sick. Stir something inside you. You might not be able to explain it\r\nto others but they will help you snap out of everything. It will be calming, painful, stinging but most of all satisfying. A satisfaction not found even when you gulp down your favourite food. A satisfaction perhaps of the knowledge that we have lived that feeling. Of having the knowledge that it existed and it continued to exist and having the faith it will continue to exist even after everything else turns to ash, to dust.\r\nWe in our ephemeral capacity cannot fathom the end of the world or the universe. Some might have an idea, but I am not even slightly inclined to those predisposed ideas of ice and fire. I can only speak of the things about which I know existed and some which ended. My school ended years ago, my college ending is still fresh and green. It comes up time to time. It’s not my entire life, but it\r\ndefinitely was a glaring, bright highlight. I am sure even my friends would agree to this. We all have carved our share of memories from it and when we said goodbyes it didn’t flash in front of our eyes. But in some way, it stayed along, the nostalgia crept along, the feeling amplified by our future hopes was not that remembered. But it stayed and it exists even to this day. Someday, when we start\r\nanother highlight of our life this will be forgotten. But there is that satisfaction that life along with everything else gives us. It allows us to go back to them again and again.\r\n\r\nBecause they exist.', 'Many come to this Institute with their own expectations, for few it changes with time, for others it doesn\'t.

The circular stated that a series of Preliminary Assessment Tests (PATs) would be conducted for the students who would appear for campus placement during the academic year 2018-2019. Students from all disciplines who are in the pre-final year  (i.e. B.Tech, Dual Degree, M.Tech, M.Sc, Int. M.Sc, MBA and MA) are required to appear in four Preliminary Assessment Tests (PATs) during the months of March and April. Each PAT will have four sections, namely Logical Reasoning, Quantitative Aptitude/ Business Analysis, Data Interpretation and Verbal Ability. In order to qualify, candidates must secure either 50% of the average mark or 30% of the total marks (whichever lower will be applicable). Aggregate marks will be used to check whether a student has qualified. In case a student fails to cross the cut-off mark over the series of these four tests, he/she will get an opportunity to appear for the 5th PAT which will be held in the month of July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA student who qualifies the series of PATs will be eligible to appear for companies across all categories. If a student fails to qualify or does not appear for all the four tests, he/she will not be eligible to appear for Category 2 and Category 3 companies during the months of July to September. But such students will be allowed to appear for all the Category 1 companies.\r\n\r\nThe notice triggered mixed reactions from students of the pre-final year, and they wanted further details about the new system. To bring more clarity to the matter, Team MM approached the TnP cell on the evening of the 3rd of February. The following clarifications regarding the notice were obtained:\r\n\r\nMM: What inspired the TnP cell to take such a step? And why is such a procedure mandatory for everyone?\r\n\r\nTnP: We want to improve the campus placement scenario and decrease the number of zero recruit companies. The performance of students will not improve if the number of companies visiting the campus increases. The Placement Committee worked very hard this year to bring in new companies but many MNCs (like Novartis, Honeywell, Samsung R&D) did not recruit any student. In fact, we have 21 companies that left with zero recruits this year. We’ve got a feedback from many companies that the students are not able to present themselves effectively during the placement session.\r\n\r\nIn order to counter this, we have taken up many initiatives for students to improve their soft skills. Five to six workshops were held by professionals on behalf of the TnP but they have gone in vain. Most of these workshops witnessed a very low attendance, with as less as 30-40 students turning up for the same. This has been highly demotivating for us.\r\n\r\nAs this approach is not working, we are hoping to provide an indirect push to increase seriousness among students. Even now, we are not completely debarring students from placements. They can sit for all companies after September and there is no bar on Category 1 companies. Students should begin to understand that just because they are in an NIT, their placement is not assured.\r\n\r\nAlso, in our institute, the number of students clearing the online tests is far less than other institutes of the same level. For example, when Deloitte visited our campus, only 30-40 students were able to clear the first round. On the other hand, in NIT Raipur around 70-80 students were shortlisted. So essentially, when the number of students clearing these tests is less, the final results are eventually affected. This shows that we need to improve our performance in the Online Tests. To achieve this objective, we have introduced the series of PATs, where we will test the students in those sections, which are usually asked during the first round screening process of most of the companies.\r\n\r\nMM: Students are not tested for core departmental subjects. Why is it so? \r\n\r\nTnP: This is the first time such a rule has been introduced and we don’t want to include everything in one go. It is a step by step process. The present system of PATs is solely based on what every company looks forward to in an applicant. The series would include core subjects, mock interviews, and other helpful measures in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nMM: Did you look up to any college that had a similar rule for getting statistics? What is the expected number of students that would fail to clear the PATs?\r\n\r\nTnP: Yes, we did. We compared with NIT Trichy, where they have a similar rule. They have an intake of around 700 students and the number of students unable to clear the test is around 30. Keeping those figures in mind and considering the kind of system we have implemented in our institute, we can expect that a maximum of 40 students (out of 1200 odd students that register for placements) will not clear the process at the end of 5th PAT. \r\n\r\nStudents who are at NIT Rourkela have obtained admission after competing at a national level, and the cutoff that we have decided seems quite achieveable. We want to inform the students that our motive is not to debar anyone but it is to make them prepared for the placement session. \r\nMM: What about those who fail to clear all the five PATs?\r\n\r\nTnP: They won’t be allowed to appear for placements during July to September for Category 2 and Category 3 companies. After September, everyone is allowed to apply for all companies.\r\n\r\nMM: There has been a notion among the students that the institute would not take such measures and when the time comes, the debarred students would be allowed to sit for placements eventually.  Can you please clarify?\r\n\r\nTnP: This rule is going to be binding and it has been implemented after a lot of discussions. We will not be altering the rule. We want the students to realize that if the TnP is serious, then they should also put some extra efforts. \r\n\r\nMM: What would be done against the students who miss one or more tests for some genuine reasons, like participation in competitions or sports tournaments?\r\n\r\nTnP: In case a student has a genuine reason for missing a test, he/she will be able to compensate the test. We will decide some alternate days where the students can make up for the missed test. This can be done at a time comfortable for both the students and the TnP. These tests will be conducted before the summer vacation.  \r\n\r\nMM: Any useful tips for students that would help students to prepare for the tests?\r\n\r\nTnP: There are numerous resources available in the library that have been purchased by the TnP for the betterment of students. They can even download materials from the NITR’s local file sharing repository. The placement manual on Monday Morning is a great source to guide students about how to prepare. So, there are a lot of resources and students just need to put a bit of extra efforts to perform well during the PATs.\r\n\r\nThe TnP cell of the institute has been putting consistent efforts to improve the placement statistics of the institute, but it’s impossible to see a significant change unless the students start preparing themselves to meet the industry requirements. Team MM hopes that the students would take the PATs seriously and a majority of them would succeed in clearing them, which would further help in improving the placement statistics of the institute.', 'On the 2nd of February, 2018, a circular was issued by the Training and Placement Cell.

This week marked the launch of Amdocs Innovation Lab 2.0, and a session on foreign internships, where final year students of different branches gave an insight into several prestigious research programs. Team MM presents to you a detailed note of the happenings: \r\n\r\n23 JANUARY 2018, BBA \r\nThe Tuesday afternoon saw a talk being given by the Amdocs Innovation Expert, Mr. Leo Paulose. He had been to the Institute for the launch of Amdocs Innovation Lab 2.0. Taking time out of his busy schedule, he gave a presentation to the NITR Junta on Disruptive Innovation and its impacts on the industry. Leo Paulose was accompanied by the Placement Manager for Amdocs, Mr. Sanjay.\r\n\r\nThe talk began at 3:30 pm and continued for two hours covering the topics of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, the impacts of these technologies on the various sectors of the industry and corporate world. The session began with Leo mainly focusing on the current disconnect between the students, the faculties, and developments of the corporate world. He further went on to say that these sessions were mainly organized to remove this huge gap and bring everyone at par with the industries.\r\n\r\nAmdocs India conducts a program called Innovation Lab, in which the students from 6 different colleges of India form teams and take part in real life projects. The top 5 among the 18 teams get an opportunity to display their idea in front of industrialists and the winning team is awarded by Amdocs.\r\n\r\nFurther, he moved on to show how different industries got affected by the disruption in some other industry, such as the hospitals and insurance companies incurring losses due to organ printing being possible through the 3D printing technology, digital cameras knocking the film based cameras out of the market. The use of machine learning and deep learning and the way these technologies are impacting the industry and bringing out new disruptions every day were also shared with the audience. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe session concluded with a video being shown on the application of Machine Learning in defence. He further exemplified that the defence industry has not exploited the features of AI very much and has a huge scope for development. Leo stated at the end:\r\n\r\nEverybody sitting right in this room has the power to make the impossible happen, the question is if you want to.\r\n24 JANUARY 2018, BBA\r\nThe session on the second day was about NITRAA and its widespread activities. The event started with a brief introduction to what NITRAA is and the teams that are associated with NITRAA. The website team is responsible for handling the website content. The database team has been looking after updating the alumni database, which they have done successfully up to the year of 1980. The newsletter team is responsible for looking after the quarterly publication of the NITRAA newsletter, the latest one being expected in February 2018. And the last is the design and photography team, as the name suggests, its role is to look after the design and photography of various NITRAA events. But these are operational teams and the focus of NITRAA in the financial year 2018-19 is to build strategic teams with more involvement of students.\r\n\r\nLeo then further emphasized on the progress of NITRAA in the last two years and how it can help the students of NITR. He also gave an update on the NITRAA Pune meet. He then moved on to the student-alumni associated projects that are going to be initiated soon. The alumni shall be providing the projects for the benefit of the institute and the blueprints shall be given; for which the students shall be applying depending on their field of interest and the selected ones shall be doing the projects.\r\n\r\nThe NITRAA session lasting for one and a half hour majorly saw an attendance of nearly 80 students. Along with the projects, the event was also to notify the students about the teams of NITRAA and the induction process for the same. The students were made aware of the contributions of NITRAA for the progress of the institute in the current academic year, and the sum amounted to 1.5 crore INR under the combined aegis of the alumni.\r\n\r\nThe event concluded with Leo saying that if the students are interested, then NITRAA can achieve much more and give a huge array of opportunities to the people of NITR.\r\n\r\n24 JANUARY 2018, TIIR AUDITORIUM \r\nParallel to this, there was a session organized for foreign internships by the Training and Placement Cell, NIT Rourkela wherein the final year students, who have had experience in foreign research internships of international repute like MITACS, DAAD, Viterbi, Charpak and SN Bose Scholarship Program, among many others, had come to interact with the first, second and third year students across all branches. The session started at 5.30 PM according to the schedule. The event witnessed an enthusiastic participation with a huge number of students coming in and filling up the vast auditorium.\r\n\r\nThe session kick-started with the final year students Prabhu Chandan and Surabhi Bhuyan from the Department of Civil Engineering narrating about their experience with Charpak Scholarship at Ifsttar institute, France. All the speakers spoke about the application process, essential preparatory steps, their internship experience and the further benefits of pursuing such an internship. After their ten minutes’ talk, they opened the discussion to the audience wherein the curious students asked their doubts and queries and got them clarified. Consequently, fourth year students including Aryaman Gupta (MPI-CBG, Dresden Area, Germany), Rohit Suri (DAAD WISE at University of Freiburg, Germany), Anubhav Ghosh (Viterbi-India program at University of Southern California, USA), Roshni Biswas (Caltech SURF at NASA Jet Propulasion Laboratory), Siddharth Pujari (NUS, Singapore), Aishwarya Shrestha (National Taiwan University, Taiwan), Manas Ranjan Pattnayak and Megha Satapathy (National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan), Tejaswini Karra (Khorana Program for Scholars at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois), Asmita Poddar (Acadenmia Sinica, Taiwan) and Prathamesh Dash (University of Astrophysics, Japan) came up to the dais and spoke about their foreign internship experiences. The speakers also gave many useful tips regarding emailing to the professors, writing SOPs, applying for Passports and Visas and arranging for accommodation for the students; so as to keep in mind while applying for coveted internships. The audience got the opportunity of asking their questions to all the speakers and get all of their doubts resolved.\r\n\r\nThe interactive session ended on a successful note with the inspired students going back to their respective hostels with great knowledge and nuances of applying for such reputed internships. Team Monday Morning congratulates and highly appreciates such initiatives by the Training and Placement Cell, NIT Rourkela and hopes such beneficial events are also organized in the future.

Read on to find more:\r\n\r\nMM: Tell us something about your childhood and schooling days.\r\n\r\nDK: I hail from a small village in the interior of Jajpur district, Odisha. I changed a few schools during my primary and secondary education. Primary days were spent in a small school in that village. As I progressed to 6th grade, I was transferred to St. Xavier’s, Jajpur. Soon after 10th, I went to complete my intermediate at ODM Public School, Bhubaneswar.\r\n\r\nMy childhood was fun-filled and exuberant. I still fondly remember those days when we didn’t have many impacts of digital products on our lives and used to play cricket during evening hours. But as I progressed to higher classes, I was bound to stay in a hostel and a certain part of this childhood mirth began to dissipate from my life. Nevertheless, I began to perform extraordinarily in academics and my name always glimmered among the list of toppers. My 12th percentile was among the top 5 percentiles in Bhubaneswar zone.\r\n\r\nMM: How did NITR happen to you? Was CSE at NITR your first choice?\r\n\r\nDK: During 12th standard, in our school, we had integrated coaching. During that time, they taught and trained us to face the entrance exams with much-needed confidence and knowledge.\r\nTalking about my branch, I was keenly interested and determined to pursue a B.Tech. degree in Computer Science in a prestigious college. Computers had always fascinated me. When I was a little boy, I really loved to play computer games and during my school days, I loved to write programs. I had a teacher in my school who was excellent in programming and he greatly contributed to feeding the coder within me. Even my elder brother is a Computer Engineer. So, in short, throughout my life, I have been continuously inspired by people around me. \r\n\r\nIn JEE Mains, I had a good rank which guaranteed my B.Tech. degree in Computer Science Engineering from NIT Rourkela. This campus was good, had good ranking among other colleges and was in my own state. Hence, I decide to settle for this option.\r\n\r\nMM: You bagged a prestigious internship through the Ekalavya Program at IIT-Bombay. Please tell our readers about the procedure that you followed to apply for it.  \r\n\r\nDK: The application process for Ekalavya usually starts from the month of January and the portal remains open until the first week of February. To get the internship through Ekalavya, there are two ways. One way is to get selected on the basis of academic performance or CGPA and the other process requires to go through a software testing round. The software testing round’s selection procedure keeps altering every year. In my year of selection, the aspirants had to prepare an animation using javascript.\r\n\r\nI had a CGPA of 9.32 which actually helped me to get this internship. After CGPA shortlisting, there was a small coding test and that required very basic knowledge of coding due to which it became very easy for me!\r\n\r\nMM: What prior projects and internships did you pursue before this? Did it help while getting selected for this internship?\r\n\r\nDK:  Before this, I had not done any internships but I had done some projects in PD lab during my 3rd year. ‘Digit recognition using machine learning’ and ‘liveliness detection’ were the two projects that I had worked on. Liveliness detection was a project which was aimed at the drivers. It could tell whether their eyes are shut or open while driving and hence could prevent road accidents to a certain extent. Apart from these, I had done few projects related to website development but it was on a small scale. I had also contributed to the technical wing of NU team of 2017.\r\n\r\nMM: What do you feel about the curriculum of the Department of CSE? How much did it help in bagging this internship?\r\n\r\nDK: Curriculum of our branch doesn’t really help in industrial applications. In our branch, the core concepts are taught elaborately but practical knowledge isn’t sufficiently provided to us. Though some subjects provide a little help in industrial applications, I think our curriculum should be shifted from theoretical foundation to a more practical foundation. This way we could produce more efficient engineers for our future.\r\n\r\nMM: Tell us about your project at IITB. How relevant was it to your area of interest?\r\n\r\nDK: The project was under Chemical Department and aimed at the back-end development of a Single Board Heater System. It was a small device which when commanded will perform experiments, and it received data over the internet. The setup was already there and we had to update the architecture. We just included some new features; besides that, the IITs help in documenting the projects and journal papers which are very helpful for the future as well.\r\n\r\nMM: Which clubs are you a part of? How much has the knowledge gained outside the classroom helped you in shaping your career?\r\n\r\nDK: I have been a part of the SPAWN club and it definitely helped because I had seniors who guided me. I was the Technical Head of the club in my third year. As of now, I am not much active in the club and I contribute as and when required. But overall being in the club has helped me very much.\r\n\r\nMM: Was it a paid internship or an unpaid one? If unpaid, what other perks did you receive?\r\n\r\nDK: The internship was an unpaid one but we received other perks such as accessing all the facilities of the institute and our accommodation was also free. I made some good friends and I was also happy to get the opportunity to work in IITB. So, internal satisfaction was the perk that I received.\r\n\r\nMM: What are your future plans?\r\n\r\nDK: I am thinking of pursuing higher studies but as of now it is not yet decided; whether I shall be doing it immediately or after working for a few years. Even if I join a company, I would be quitting it to pursue my higher studies in the coming 4 to 5 years.\r\n\r\nMM: Do you have any message for our readers?\r\n\r\nDK: The teaching in the classes is fine but the students need to pursue their passion. The higher studies or the industrial jobs require a determination on the part of the student so I recommend that they should work hard for their passion.', 'Debakanta Kar, a final year student from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering bagged an internship through the prestigious Ekalavya program of IITB.

Given below is an extract from his interview regarding the latest proceedings in our institute.\r\n\r\nMM: There was a plan to increase the mess fees by 20 INR per day to improve the quality of the food. Is it going to be implemented? If yes, by when will it be done?\r\n\r\nAB: I want to open a national level tender in order to attract better caterers. At present, all the caterers are local to this area and there is no competition among them. I think more competition among caterers will result in better quality of food for the boarders in halls. I also want to implement a centralized mess menu. On the top of this, if students want extra food, they will be given the provision to purchase it. In order to make this happen, students need to pay a bit more than the current mess fess. I am planning to do this from the beginning of the next session.\r\n\r\nMM: What are the plans for the indoor sports stadium? When is the construction set to begin? And what inspired to take up the new project?\r\n\r\nAB: I would like to finish the construction of the indoor stadium within the duration of my tenure, which will end in 2021. The MOU is set to be signed very soon for this project. The Building and Works Committee has already approved of the construction and it has been passed in the BOG meeting as well. The only condition given by the BOG was that this construction can begin once all the existing projects are finished. All of the existing projects are expected to end by the end of July. \r\n\r\nMHRD has also changed its process of funding. Instead of giving the sum of money at once as a grant, they are now doing it project-wise. MHRD will now fund the entire project. The money for this stadium will be sanctioned in two months. The design for the stadium is completed and it has also been circulated among students to know about their response. The indoor stadium will be equipped with top-notch facilities such as the squash courts, badminton court, basketball courts and even rock climbing and roller skating arenas. The plan also includes entertainment rooms where concerts or sports matches can be screened. There is an open-air theatre as well.\r\n\r\nMM: In your last interview, you had mentioned that you wanted to make the dispensary available 24*7? What is the progress with that? When is it going to happen?\r\n\r\nAB: The plan to make the dispensary 24*7 available is one of my top priorities. Right now there are only three doctors and it would be impossible to run a 24-hour service with them. Earlier I had proposed the conversion of some vacant posts (like a technical officer) to the post of a doctor in the dispensary. By doing this we can get more doctors but this proposal was rejected in the BOG meeting. However, I will be proposing this idea once again because it’s very crucial for an institute like ours to have a 24x7 operational dispensary.\r\n\r\nMM: With the end of the academic year approaching rapidly, do you think the initiative to change the curriculum has been successful?\r\n\r\nAB: I have heard that the first-year students have not fared very well in the last semester. But I believe that the remedial classes conducted by the Counseling Cell were of great help for the students of the first year. We need to understand that for any change of this scale, especially when its made for a large number of students and professors, a bit of time is required to make the entire process smooth.\r\n\r\nHowever, students should be happy as the system is more flexible now. New options such as branch change and minor degree have also been made available for them.\r\nMM: A plan was proposed to put more emphasis on the research for Under Graduate students starting from their second year? What are the recent developments in the plan?\r\n\r\nAB: In our country, we have a huge talent pool, but our universities don’t break into the top 100 positions in the world rankings. The Government of India is giving huge scholarships to push research among students, especially in NITs and IITs. Now, coming to our institute a plan was proposed to put emphasis on the B.Tech. project from the 2nd year itself rather than focussing on it only in the 4th year. But, I had another idea in which I wanted to make the B.Tech. thesis optional. By doing this we will ensure that only those who are really dedicated will work for their thesis. This idea was however dropped after discussion with the committee and we are yet to reach a conclusion on this.\r\n\r\nMM: The institute’s NIRF ranking has dropped to 15th as opposed to last year’s 12th? What do you think has played a factor in this? What can be done in the upcoming year to bring the ranking back up?\r\n\r\nAB: Although our rank has dropped in the engineering category, our rank has improved in the overall university rankings. These rankings are just a bunch of numbers. From what I have seen, we lost the most number of points in perception category. However, we gained a lot of points on the research front. No NIT is even close to us in terms of research, including NIT Trichy. At the end of the day, I can only give the best infrastructure and facilities but it is up to the faculty and students to push NITR to a good place.\r\n\r\nMM: Some complaints have been raised by the students about professors not showing up to classes? Can a check and balance system be implemented to ensure that this doesn’t happen?\r\n\r\nAB: Over the past one year, I have tried to change this scenario a lot. I do random checks on a regular basis and each time I find that some professors are not present in their classes. But as one person, there is only so much I can do alone. I think the situation has improved starkly over the past one year. I don’t expect every faculty to be a good teacher. Those who have a passion for teaching will always fare to be better teachers. But it is essential that all of them come to the class regardless of their interest towards teaching as it is their duty.\r\n\r\nMM: What is the update on the railway concession form?\r\n\r\nAB: There are some logistical issues with the railway concession form. We are supposed to go to Chakradarpur which is quite far away and a remote location. So, this process isn’t happening very smoothly. We will still try to make it happen. I have requested the Registrar’s office to look into this matter. They keep telling me that the location of the office is leading to a lot of issues, but I will make a follow-up on this. \r\n\r\nMM: There has been a plan to set up CCD on campus. When will this happen? And what’s the progress as of now?', 'With the end of the academic year fast approaching, Team MM caught up with the Honorable Director to help clarify some doubts and resolve issues.
